The United Nations Environment Program estimates that by switching just 40 percent of households, power consumption would drop by 20 percent, cutting 2.74 million tons of CO2 emission by the end of 2021 -- as much as would be created by consuming 308 million gallons of gasoline, according to the EPA Greenhouse Gas Calculator. As part of its efforts for a greener future, Morocco has also started to transition its 15,000 mosques to renewable energy, and in July it banned the production, sale and use of plastic bags, of which it used three billion each year. A $3.5 billion economy boost Mouline, who's also a member of the Steering Committee of COP22, says energy efficiency is the cheapest way for countries to meet their targets under the Paris agreement. The government set some ambitious goals. Fifty two percent of our energy capacity must come from renewables by 2030, and by the same date we must achieve 20 percent better energy efficiency in all sectors: transport, housing, agriculture.", "Created": "2016-11-06T21:42:49.0000000Z", "EventProcessedUtcTime": "2016-11-06T21:42:50.0576568Z", "Locations": [{"type": "Point", "properties": {"name": "Benghazi"}, "coordinates": [20.06859, 32.11486]}], "Source": "twitter", "PartitionKey": "twitter", "MessageId": "795380945289412600", "Keywords": ["Morocco"], "EventEnqueuedUtcTime": "2016-11-06T21:42:48.9830000Z"}
